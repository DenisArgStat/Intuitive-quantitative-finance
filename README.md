Intuitive Quantitative Finance — Articles, Code & Projects

Welcome to Intuitive Quantitative Finance, a growing collection of articles, Jupyter notebooks, mathematical derivations, visualizations, and computational experiments covering:
•    quantitative finance
•    option pricing
•    probability & stochastic processes
•    PDEs and numerical methods
•    statistics & data science
•    Monte-Carlo and simulation techniques

This repository accompanies my public articles on Medium and LinkedIn, and serves simultaneously as a portfolio, learning resource, and reference library for anyone interested in building intuition behind modern quantitative methods.

Purpose of This Repository

This repo is designed to be:

✔ A learning companion

Each article is supplemented with rigorous derivations, code, and graphics.

✔ A portfolio of quantitative work

Recruiters and collaborators can see clear, reproducible demonstrations of technical skills.

✔ A technical archive

All formulas, figures, notebooks, and experiments are preserved and version-controlled.

✔ A living project

New articles and projects will continue to be added over time.
